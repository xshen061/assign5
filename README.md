Requirements and design:
1.	The software must have 4 different activities. Each of them is accessible by selecting a graphical icon from the main menu (Toolbar).
2.	Each Activity uses: 
    1) a fragment
    2) a ListView to present items.
       a) When selecting an item from the ListView, the screen shows detailed information about the item selected.
       b) The items listed in the ListView are stored by the application, so:
          i) All entered items will appear the next time the application is launched. 
          ii) User can modify items (add, delete, update, etc.), which would also be stored.
    3)	an AsyncTask: open a Database, retrieve data from a server, save data, etc.
    4)	at least 1 progress bar
    5)	at least 1 button
    6)	at least 1 edit text input method
    7)	at least 1 Toast/Snackbar/dialog notification.
